## Project Overview
This project analyzes educational data for intermediate colleges across Pakistan, focusing on factors such as affiliation, sector (public/private), and ratings. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), this project aims to uncover regional disparities, performance trends, and provide actionable insights to improve educational standards across the nation.

---

## Objectives
- Identify performance trends based on sector and affiliation.
- Analyze geographic disparities to highlight underserved regions.
- Inform stakeholders with insights to bridge educational gaps.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: Intermediate colleges dataset across Pakistan.
- **Features**: Includes columns such as Name, Location, Study Program, Sector, Affiliation, and Rating.
- **Cleaning and Preprocessing Steps**: Handled missing values and duplicates to ensure clean data for analysis.

---

## Data Analysis
Analysis was conducted using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations. Key visualizations include:
- Distribution of colleges by affiliation.
- Comparison of ratings across sectors.
- Location-based analysis to examine regional distribution.

---

## Key Findings
1. **Affiliation Distribution**: Describes the breakdown by types of affiliations.
2. **Sector Comparison**: Insights into how ratings differ between public and private sectors.
3. **Geographic Analysis**: Highlights regional disparities in the number of colleges and average ratings.

---

## Recommendations
1. **Invest in Underserved Regions**: Suggest opening new colleges or improving resources in specific areas.
2. **Improve Low-Rating Sectors**: Targeted interventions are suggested for areas where quality improvements are needed.
3. **Expand Affiliation Partnerships**: Encouraging balanced distribution of affiliations can benefit areas with fewer resources.
